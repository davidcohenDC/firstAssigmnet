# FirstAssignment
This project contains a template for using [JPF](http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki) with [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/).
Particularly, it contains a build script that downloads and configures JPF and its dependencies, 
and a sample class that can be used to run JPF on a simple Java program.
